2024 Instructor: Mahmood Amintoosi

I should mention that the original material of this course was from [Graph Neural Networks](https://github.com/Alireza-Akhavan/graph-neural-network) notebooks, by [Alireza Akhavan](https://github.com/Alireza-Akhavan). I have forked his repository and modified it to suit my own needs and preferences. I would like to thank him for his great work and generosity.
