Welcome to this hands-on workshop, where we'll delve into the exciting world of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)! GNNs have revolutionized Machine Learning by enabling effective analysis of complex graph-structured data. To help you get started, I've curated a concise guide (study sheet) that will introduce you to the fundamentals of GNNs and bring you up-to-speed with the latest advancements.

**Some valuable resources to deepen our understanding of GNNs:**

* [Gentle Introduction to GNNs](https://distill.pub/2021/gnn-intro/)  (by Distill)
* [Understanding Convolutions on Graphs](https://distill.pub/2021/understanding-gnns/) (by Distill)
* [Math Behind Graph Neural Networks](https://rish-16.github.io/posts/gnn-math/) (by Rishabh Anand)

**Some hands-on coding exercises using PyTorch to implement GNNs:**
