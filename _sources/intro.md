Welcome to this hands-on workshop, where we'll delve into the exciting world of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)! GNNs have revolutionized Machine Learning by enabling effective analysis of complex graph-structured data. To help you get started, I've curated a concise guide (study sheet) that will introduce you to the fundamentals of GNNs and bring you up-to-speed with the latest advancements.

**Some valuable resources to deepen our understanding of GNNs:**

* [Gentle Introduction to GNNs](https://gta-lab.github.io/gnn-intro/)  (by Distill)
* [Understanding Convolutions on Graphs](https://gta-lab.github.io/understanding-gnns/) (by Distill)
* [Math Behind Graph Neural Networks](https://rish-16.github.io/posts/gnn-math/) (by Rishabh Anand)

**Our main source book is: Hands-on graph neural networks using Python**

* [Hands-on graph neural networks using Python](https://library-search.open.ac.uk/discovery/fulldisplay?vid=44OPN_INST:VU1&search_scope=MyInst_and_CI&tab=Everything&docid=alma9953021868502316&lang=en&context=L&adaptor=Local%20Search%20Engine&query=sub,exact,%20Python%20,AND&mode=advanced&offset=30) : practical techniques and architectures for building powerful graph and deep learning apps with Pytorch
